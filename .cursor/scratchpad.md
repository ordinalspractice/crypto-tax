## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The application has been fully implemented according to requirements.
- All components and functionality have been tested in the development environment.
- The app is ready to be deployed to Vercel. See DEPLOYMENT.md for instructions.

## Lessons

- NBP API requires formatting dates from DD-MM-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD format
- Added fallback mechanism when exact exchange rate date is not available
- Using React Context or Redux would be beneficial if the app grows in complexity
